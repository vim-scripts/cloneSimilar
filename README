DESCRIPTION
This plugin combines the buffer cloning functionality of clone.vim

EditSimilar.vim (vimscript #2544) to provide :CloneSubstitute,
:ClonePlus etc. command variants of the original :CloneAs command.

USAGE
:ClonePlus,  :CloneMinus,  :CloneSubstitute,  :CloneRoot
:SClonePlus, :SCloneMinus, :SCloneSubstitute, :SCloneRoot
                        Duplicate and edit the current buffer to a file with a
                        similar name, using the substitutions and iterations
                        provided by the EditSimilar.vim plugin.
